<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p> Our goal with this cafe is to provide a welcoming place for those 
very victims to meet others like them, thus creating new bonds and friendships.
The age range would consist mostly of people from the ages of 12 to 25. 
Many youths come up with clubs of their own at schools that often times are turned down. 
And with our clubhoouse/cafe, we plan to provide a safe space for these youths to spend time creating 
friendships with others that they wouldn't have otherwise conversed with on a daily basis. We hope to
bred a new generation of more comfortable and sociable fans.</p>
<h2>How We Work</h2>
<img src="wifi.gif" width="250" height="250">
<p>Operation hours are from 3pm to 9pm Monday to Thursday, 10am to 10pm from Friday to Saturday, 
Sundays are closed. (Times are subject to change based on events and holidays). OtaCafe is to be organized as
a coffee shop front with an arcade back. The shop is to have the free wifi service and inspiration from many
Japanese styled cafes located throughout Ikebukuro and Akihabara.
[This might need to go into home: 
A late opening is for the sake of the younger patrons in school. This will cut back on students 
skipping and keeping them focusedin school.We want to support the local schools by having this 
business accessible to the students and their parents as wellas promoting their interest in an education.
 We will try to gain access to school calenders of attending so inclusion can be achieved. ]
