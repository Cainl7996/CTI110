<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>We understand these games are fun but we only have <em>ONE</em> copy of each game. We also understand how 
showing off can get a bit intense, so here are some things to keep you in the loop of how the gaming sector will
work.</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type:disc"><strong><b>
	<li> Do not throw, bend, leave disk out of case.</li>
	<li> Do not wipe disk off with anything other than the provided wipe.</li>
	<li> Do not bring in personal games </li>
	<li> DO NOT BRING IN CUSTOM CONTROLLERS!!</li>
	</strong></b></ol>
<p>We want our customers to understand that if personal items are indeed lost after bringing them into the clubhouse then
we are not responsible for the item(s) being missing. And if we are missing a must need game, please email us
at the address located in the "Contact Us" tab.</p>
